Once upon a time there was a crow named Koki. Koki was a very clever crow. 
He always found solutions to all problems. One day in his village there 
was a drought. All the rivers,lakes, wells were drying out all the fishes in the waterbodies were dying. All the 
animals had no water to drink. So the monkey and the crow decided to fetch water.
